# Code Complexity Analysis Report Generator
#
# This script analyzes the complexity of Rust code in this repository by running
# complexity tests and generating a summary report highlighting the most complex functions.

set -euo pipefail

# Colors for output (harmonized with Makefile)
COLOR_RESET=$(tput sgr0)
# shellcheck disable=SC2034  # Used in printf statements when formatting output
COLOR_BOLD=$(tput bold)
# shellcheck disable=SC2034  # Reserved for future output highlighting
COLOR_GREEN=$(tput setaf 2)
# shellcheck disable=SC2034  # Reserved for future output highlighting
COLOR_YELLOW=$(tput setaf 3)
COLOR_BLUE=$(tput setaf 4)
#
# What it does:
#   1. Runs cargo test complexity to execute complexity analysis tests
#   2. Filters out test framework noise and formatting artifacts
#   3. Extracts and summarizes complexity metrics from the test output
#   4. Identifies the top 3 most complex functions in two categories:
#      - Cyclomatic Complexity: Measures control flow complexity (branches, loops, conditions)
#      - Data Flow Complexity: Measures data dependency and state management complexity
#   5. Generates a readable report saved to dev/scripts/complexity_report.txt
#
# Output:
#   - Report is displayed in the terminal (via tee)
#   - Also saved to: dev/scripts/complexity_report.txt
#   - Shows full complexity analysis plus a summary of top 3 most complex functions
#
# Metrics explained:
#   - Cyclomatic Complexity: Higher values indicate more decision points (if/else, loops, matches)
#     * Lower is better (simpler control flow)
#     * Values > 10-15 may indicate functions that need refactoring
#   - Data Flow Complexity: Measures how data moves through the function
#     * Higher values indicate complex state management or data dependencies
#     * Helps identify functions with potential maintainability issues
#
# Usage:
#   ./dev/scripts/complexity_report.sh
#   cat dev/scripts/complexity_report.txt  # View the saved report
#
# Requirements:
#   - Rust toolchain (cargo)
#   - Complexity tests must be defined in tests/ directory
#   - Project must compile and tests must run successfully
#
