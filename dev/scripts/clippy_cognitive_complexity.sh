# Clippy Cognitive Complexity Report Generator
#
# This script runs cargo clippy and extracts cognitive complexity warnings/errors,
# then sorts them by complexity and provides an overview of files and functions
# that need adjustments.
#
# Usage:
#   ./dev/scripts/clippy_cognitive_complexity.sh
#
# Output:
#   - Displays sorted cognitive complexity issues
#   - Shows summary statistics
#   - Lists files and functions that exceed the threshold
#   - Saves full report to: dev/scripts/clippy_cognitive_complexity_report.txt
#
# The script resolves the repository root from its own location, so it can be
# run from any current working directory.
