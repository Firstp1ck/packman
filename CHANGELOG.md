## [0.1.4] - 2026-04-25

# UniPack v0.1.4

## Highlights

- **Fuzzy search mode in both package views.** While search is active, press `Ctrl+f` to toggle normal substring matching and fuzzy subsequence matching in the main list and the all-upgradables overlay.
- **Backend-aware bulk upgrade behavior.** In the all-upgradables view, UniPack now distinguishes package-level upgrades from backend-native full-system updates, then executes the safest matching strategy for each selected backend.
- **Safer system update actions.** Full-system updates now use a verified support policy and explicit confirmation flow so unsupported or stale selections are handled more predictably.
- **Quick full-system update shortcut.** On supported package-manager tabs, `Ctrl+u` opens a confirmation prompt and runs the backend-native full-system update from the main view.

## Changed behavior

- **New search toggle:** `Ctrl+f` switches normal ↔ fuzzy matching while search mode is enabled.
- **New system-update shortcut:** `Ctrl+u` is now reserved for full-system update on the active package manager (when supported) instead of page-up movement.
- **Footer/help hints updated:** key hints now surface system-update availability and the revised paging behavior.

## Other changes

- Internal planning docs were expanded for potential future backend coverage (conda, dnf, gem, pipx, and zypper).
- Release automation and packaging metadata were updated during this cycle.

For install options, supported package managers, and the key reference, see [README](../README.md). Maintainer automation steps (tagging/AUR/wiki helpers) are available in `dev/scripts/release.sh`.

# UniPack v0.1.4

## Highlights

- **Fuzzy search mode in both package views.** While search is active, press `Ctrl+f` to toggle normal substring matching and fuzzy subsequence matching in the main list and the all-upgradables overlay.
- **Backend-aware bulk upgrade behavior.** In the all-upgradables view, UniPack now distinguishes package-level upgrades from backend-native full-system updates, then executes the safest matching strategy for each selected backend.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-04-23

# UniPack v0.1.3

## Highlights

- **New backend: pnpm support.** UniPack now detects and lists globally installed `pnpm` packages, including outdated counts and upgrade paths, so Node users who prefer pnpm can manage updates in the same TUI flow as npm and bun.
- **More reliable APT upgrades.** UniPack now runs `apt update` before APT package upgrades, so Debian/Ubuntu-family upgrade actions use fresh package metadata by default.
- **Smoother pacman recovery flow.** When upgrades fail because Arch mirrors need a refresh, UniPack now offers a clearer retry path and improved key handling around confirmation so you can recover and continue with less friction.
- **Stability-focused internals.** The app and package-manager code were split into smaller focused modules, which improves maintainability and reduces risk when adding or changing backends.

## Changed behavior

- **APT now refreshes metadata before upgrade.** APT-backed upgrades consistently perform `apt update` first, then retry the package upgrade with current repository state.
- **Arch/pacman upgrade retries are more guided.** Mirror-refresh retry prompts and confirmation handling were refined; if you previously saw awkward key behavior after mirror failures, the flow is now more consistent.

## Other changes

- PKGBUILD and development quality scripts were updated as part of this release cycle.

For install options, supported package managers, and the key reference, see [README](../README.md). Maintainer automation steps (tagging/AUR/wiki helpers) are available in `dev/scripts/release.sh`.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-23

# UniPack v0.1.2

## Highlights

- **Optional sudo warm-up at startup:** on a Unix TTY, when a manager that benefits from a live sudo session is present, UniPack can ask whether to run `sudo -v` before the TUI so the password prompt happens up front with normal terminal I/O. You can still skip it and authenticate manually. The privilege hint in the UI switches between “run `sudo -v`” and “sudo is enabled” once a session is warmed. If you opt in and `sudo -v` fails, the process exits non-zero so scripts see the failure clearly.
- **Arch: pip tab follows `python-*` packages:** when `pacman` is available, the pip source lists distro `python-*` packages (repos and AUR), shows the suffix after `python-`, and runs upgrades/removes through **yay** or **paru** when installed, otherwise **`sudo pacman`**, instead of treating global Python like a generic PyPI `pip` list. This matches how Arch expects system Python libraries to be managed.
- **Paru without yay:** if only **paru** is installed, the AUR backend is registered automatically (same idea as yay-only setups).
- **More accurate counts and upgrades:** Bun’s outdated count is aligned with the same list logic as the tab UI; AUR upgrade metadata is scoped to explicitly foreign (`-Qem`) packages so tab counts and bulk upgrades stay consistent.

## Changed behavior

- **Arch (and other pacman-based systems):** the **pip** tab is no longer a plain global `pip` inventory when `pacman` is on `PATH`. Expect **`python-*`** naming and pacman/AUR helper actions instead. On other platforms, pip behavior is unchanged. Details and install examples are in the project [README](../README.md).

## Other changes

- **`install.sh`** warns when fetching **darwin-x86_64** binaries (Rosetta-era) and points you at **darwin-arm64** or building from source.
- **Docs and screenshots:** README and the main screenshot were refreshed for this release (including Arch pip semantics).

For install options, supported managers, and the key reference, see [README](../README.md). Maintainer-oriented steps (AUR, tagging, etc.) live in `dev/scripts/release.sh` if you package or ship releases.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-22

# UniPack v0.1.1

## Focus

UniPack is now an **update tool**, not an installer. Use your native package manager to install new packages; use UniPack to see and apply updates across all of them from one place. Remove is still supported for cleaning up what you already have.

## Highlights

- **Security fix — shell injection closed:** privileged actions (upgrade and remove) no longer pass package names through `sh -c`. Names are handed to each package manager as a direct argument, so shell metacharacters can never be interpreted. This removes a real injection path that previously existed when typing into the search box.
- **Install feature removed:** the `i` keybinding and in-app install flow are gone. UniPack now focuses entirely on upgrades and removals. Install new packages with your native tool (e.g. `sudo pacman -S …`, `sudo apt install …`, `pip install …`).
- **Safer privileged actions:** UniPack checks sudo readiness before privileged remove and upgrade operations, with clearer one-time guidance for apt/pacman/AUR/rpm/snap flows.
- **Better upgrade feedback:** single-package upgrades show a clearer progress strip with elapsed-time feedback.
- **Faster bulk update workflow:** the all-upgradables overlay supports search filtering and clearer empty-state handling when no matches are found.
- **Improved platform behavior:** distro detection and key handling were refined for more consistent behavior across environments.

## Breaking changes

- The `i` key no longer installs packages. If you scripted or muscle-memoried the `/`-then-`i` flow, switch to your package manager's CLI for installs.
- The `i` entry is removed from the footer hint and `unipack --help` output.

## Other changes

- Project naming and repository references were aligned around **UniPack** for consistency.
